# Python 2 Geocoding

## ArcGIS Support

This tool uses the python requests package that was added in the ArcGIS Desktop 10.5 release. Therefore, support for ArcGIS Desktop, without modification to the python packages, is 10.5 or greater.

If you are unable to upgrade to a version with requests, requests can be pip installed into the ArcGIS Desktop python installation.
